Work-in-progress: there's certainly a better way to do this, but this was just a quick hack to make things work for now.  Probably need 'sealed secrets' or similar.

Need to drop files in here that contain the relevant credentials (for obvious reasons, these are not checked in to git):

 - `eventstreams-apikey/binding` - should contain the API key for connecting to eventstreams
 - `gsa-eda-sandbox-db/root.crt` - should contain the postgres server certificate in PEM format
 - `postgresql-pwd/binding` - should contain the password for postgres
 - `postgresql-url/binding` - should contain the URL for postgres (`jdbc:postgresql://server:port/dbname`)
 - `postgresql-user/binding` - should contain the postgres username
 - `eventstreams-pem/es-cert.pem` - should contain the Event Streams PEM certificate
 - `eventstreams-truststore/es-cert.jks`  - should contain the Event Streams truststore
 - `eventstreams-truststore/password`  - should contain the password for the Event Streams truststore
